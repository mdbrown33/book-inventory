# freeCodeCamp CSS Certification Project #1

This is my submission for the second CSS certification project on freecodecamp.org. This project is part of the Responsive Web Design Certification, which in itself is also a section of the Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum. I have listed the link to the project prompt, project instructions, and user stories that must be included in the project.

![Example Project Image](project-example.png)

Build an app that is functionally similar to this example project [available at project link above]. Try not to copy the example project, give it your own personal style.

User Stories:

1. You should have an h1 element with the text Book Inventory.

2. You should have a table element with columns named Title, Author, Category, Status, and Rate.

3. Your table should have at least four rows, the first for the column headings and the rest filled with book information.

4. Each table row inside the table body should have either the class read, to-read, or in-progress.

5. td elements of the Status column should contain a span element with the class of status surrounding the text Read, To Read, or In Progress, depending on the class of that row.

6. td elements of the Rate column should contain a span element with the class of rate wrapping three empty span elements.

7. .rate elements placed inside .read rows should have an additional class with the value of either one, two, or three, depending on the personal rate. This value should come after rate.

8. You should create three attribute selectors to target the elements with the class of read, to-read, and in-progress, and set their background-image property to use a linear-gradient of your choice.

9. You should set the display property of each span element to inline-block.

10. You should use an attribute selector to target the span elements with the class of status that are descendants of tr elements with the class of to-read and set their border and background-image properties.

11. You should use an attribute selector to target the span elements with the class of status that are descendants of tr elements with the class of read and set their border and background-image properties.

12. You should use an attribute selector to target the span elements with the class of status that are descendants of tr elements with the class of in-progress and set their border and background-image properties.

13. You should use an attribute selector to target the span elements with the class of status and the span elements with the class value starting with rate and set their height, width, and padding properties.

14. You should use an attribute selector to target the span elements which are direct children of span elements with the class value starting with rate and set their border, border-radius, margin, height, width, and background-color properties.

15. You should use an attribute selector to target the first descendant of span elements that have the word one as a part of their class value and set its background-image property to use a linear-gradient.

16. You should use an attribute selector to target the first two descendants of span elements that have the word two as a part of their class value and set their background-image property to use a linear-gradient.

17. You should use an attribute selector to target the three span elements that are descendants of span elements that have the word three as a part of their class value and set their background-image property to use a linear-gradient.
